# hello-world
This is one of my first repositories and its main purpose is to learn about Github and functionalities in Github. I might later on use it for storing ideas for projects etc.

My name is Dan Kindstrand, i'm 23 and is currently studying mediatechnology at Linkopings University in Sweden, but is in the process of returning to my former education in industrial economics at Mid Sweden University. I've always been interested in code and IT, but have never had any real life experience with it, something i'm now hoping to change.
